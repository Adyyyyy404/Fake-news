# Fake News Detection using Machine Learning and SHAP

This project implements a machine learning model to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using classical NLP techniques and interprets the results using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model explainability.

## 🚀 Features

- Text preprocessing using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Classification using Logistic Regression
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Model explainability with SHAP to understand feature contributions
- Interactive interface built with Streamlit
